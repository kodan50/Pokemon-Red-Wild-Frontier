# Pok√©mon Smoke

I am creating a simple mod called Pokemon Smoke.

While it was designed only to mod Pokemon Red, it also builds a Pokemon Blue ROM, since I can't be asked to change the makefile to exclude it, but I have no idea how it plays, so YMMV.

The name "Smoke" doesn't seem to be taken by any mods that I could find with my extensive 10 second Google search, and it matches the color of my flash cart.

This mod in particular was designed so it can still work natively with Pokemon Stadium, Pokemon Stadium 2, and trading with the original Gameboy games. I haven't any friends to test the trading with, my N64 is buried, and NRage Input Plugin doesn't seem to want to work with my computer, so who knows if it still works? This could all be a waste of time...

This mod was just for fun and shouldn't be considered terribly serious, but I will outline the changes that are being made below:
*most are probably WIP*

Some changed dialogue. I never did like Lance's fakeout speech.  
All pokemon can be obtained without glitches. I tried to make all the same pokemon catchable in blue and red, so their locations are the same by replacing duplicates in the wild pokemon lists.  
Two trades were adjusted. One to get a Mew by trading a Dragonite, and one to fix the "Your Raichu has evolved!" bungle up. I opted to change the pokemon instead of the trade dialogue because the dialogue is used less.  
The four trade-only pokemon now evolve through level up instead.  
All pokemon levels have been adjusted. Wild pokemon and trainer pokemon levels have been booted to slightly absurd amounts. I have no idea on the impact to balance yet. Good luck in the gauntlet!  
I hacked up Cinnabar island with a cleaver to address one of the Missingno glitches. Funny enough, that Missingno probably causes the least amount of damage, but whatever.  
All trainers in the Pokemon Gym will need to be battled before you can battle the gym leader. I always felt it was strange that you can avoid most of them, so I changed it.  
I made some visual tweaks to some of the maps. Some might be considered heresy, but I think if you are offended by some of the changes I made to the maps, you should go outside and touch grass, and not let a pet project from a stranger on the internet ruin your day.
